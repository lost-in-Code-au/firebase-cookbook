### React-native Cookbook with firebase database

This project was built an recipe book for my family to use, it uses a live database so we can all keep up to date with each others recipes.

This project was developed two ways, 1) was a normal [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project and 2) was a [Expo](https://expo.io/) react-native project. After I had the basics for react-native I moved everything over to Expo and found that while Expo has some limitations and stabilised a lot of the react-native issues I was having.
